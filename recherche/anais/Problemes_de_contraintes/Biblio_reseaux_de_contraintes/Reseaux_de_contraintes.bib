The talk will focus on high-end solutions to unique but immense problems. This, as opposed to oﬀ-the-shelf solutions which are suitable for more commoditized problems. I argue that the former case is where cuttingedge satisfaction technology can bring the most signiﬁcant impact. The following is an extended abstract of my talk.},
